I am a first year student in UTSW. Before my PhD, I earned BSs in Shandong University. During my undergraduate, I did some bioinformatics research at Wei Lab. Please see my CV for more information.

My research interest is using machine learning to decipher the principle of genomics or more generally, all biology problems.
